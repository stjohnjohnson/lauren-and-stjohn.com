      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <div class="one-span small">
        <div class="block">
          <blockquote>So how did you guys meet?</blockquote>
          <p>
            It all started when we both attended the same college,
            <a href="http://www.sacredheart.edu" target="_blank">Sacred Heart
            University in Fairfield, CT.</a>  By pure chance, we ended up
            living in the <b>same freshman dorm</b> only <b>three floors apart.</b>
            If that wasn't enough, it turned out we even had a common acquaintance,
            Lauren's roommate.
            <br />
            <br />
            With so much luck on our side, it wasn't long before we became
            <b><em>great friends.</em></b>  Watching movie marathons, ordering
            <abbr title="MMmmmmm.. General Tso's Chicken is the best">late-night
            Chinese food</abbr>, and chatting until dawn - <b>absolutely
            inseparable.</b>  To no one's surprise, our friendship quickly
            flourished into a <span style="color:#F00">romance,</span> and the
            rest is <em>history.</em>
          </p>

          <blockquote>How did you end up here in California?</blockquote>
          <p>
            Throughout our relationship, we talked about <em>someday moving to
            <span style="color: #F90">California</span>.</em>  And once we both
            finished grad school, we realized that this was the <b>perfect time</b>
            to look into moving.  Little did we know how <em><b>incredibly soon
            </b></em> this would really happen.
            <br />
            <br />
            St. John did some looking around for jobs.  And after a few interviews
            with <span style="color:#63F">Yahoo,</span> <b>BAM!</b>  We were
            <em>packed up</em> and <em>moved out</em> to sunny
            <span style="color: #F90">California</span> in under a month!
          </p>

          <blockquote>Alright, how did you pop the question?</blockquote>
          <p>
            After living in <span style="color: #F90">California</span> for only
            a week, we decided to spend a day (August 7th, 2010) exploring Napa Valley with a
            bunch of friends visiting from Connecticut.  Our final stop on our personal wine tour was the beautiful
            <b><abbr title="That's right, Castle of Love... :)">Castello di Amorosa.</abbr></b>
            <br />
            <br />
            By that time, Lauren was a bit <em>tipsy</em> (luckily) and I (St. John) was
            able to convince her to come explore the top of the hill with me.
            After strolling through the <span style="color: #606">grape vines,</span>
            overlooking the castle, I got down on one knee, proposed, and <b>she said YES!</b>

            has been one of my closest and dearest friends since the 3rd grade, where our friendship started over a bag of Cheetos we shared. We have had so many fun memories together throughout grade school, high school, spending time together during holiday breaks from college, and going on amazing vacations. Our families always made time to get together for meals and celebrate holidays, traditions we miss since moving to California. Lisa is a wonderful friend and I am so excited to have her by my side on my wedding day.

            and I have been friends since the third grade. I don't think there is anyone that can make me laugh like quite like Lauren can. She is the type of friend that weeks can go by without talking to her, but we just pick up where we left off like nothing has changed. Lauren is such a supportive, honest and caring friend and I am so excited to have her be part of my wedding.

            and I met in college, both being psychology majors we had a few classes together. Our fiancés also became close friends, both being computer science majors. We would enjoy having each other over for dinners and board games and drinking wine of course. Emily is a great friend, she always has good advice and she is such an easy person to talk to.  I have the honor of being one of Emily's bridesmaids in her upcoming wedding and cannot wait for her to be part of mine as well.

            is the ultimate best friend.  It's all a little hazy, but as far as I recall, it started with a couple
            of shared computer science classes, a need for web programming assistance, and a slight chance of gas.
            Over the course of the next four years, he and I logged hundreds of hours of disc golf, inappropriately
            completed various homework assignments, discussed deep intellectual topics, waged war across many board
            games, and many other awesome things.  Overall, Evan is absolutely hilarious <i>(even though Emily won't admit it),</i>
            smart, caring, and incredibly selfless.
            I am honored to have him as my best man.

            was the first person I worked with when I started at Yahoo!  When I met Cory, I immediately thought,
            <i>"Wow.. those are some damn awesome sideburns."</i>  From there, it only went downhill - it turned out he is
            dangerously intelligent and painfully humorous. Now almost a year later, I can't seem to get rid of
            him.  I'm excited (or nervous) to have him as part of our wedding.

            is my future brother-in-law.  I've known him for almost as long as I've know Lauren.
            While Jonathan pretends to be a rapper, deep down inside he just wants to
            write code and dissect computers.
            I always feel bad for Lauren as Jonathan and I can easily get carried away with out geeky conversations.
            He completes the trio of nerds in our group and I'm pumped for him to be a groomsman in our wedding.

          From the day your child is born, all you wish for them is that they are healthy and will live a fulfilling and happy life.  John and I have been blessed with both and much, much more.
          We are so proud of Lauren, for who she is and what she has accomplished in her life so far.   Now our beautiful daughter is embarking on a new phase in her life; becoming a married woman.  We could not have wished for a more wonderful soon-to-be son-in-law than St. John.    John, I and Jonathan are so delighted to welcome him into our family.  Our family is small,  so we are also glad to have Cynthia and Vinni as part of it now, too.
          <br class="clear" /><br class="clear" />
          We look forward to sharing many new beginnings and happy times with all of them.

            A man stands before me.  Do I recognize him?  There are those baby blue eyes full of wonder and purpose.  There is an air that surrounds him that is confident and trusting.  As he moves, there is a gentleness that, too, is purposeful yet patient.  And the voice?  Definitely inquisitive, soothing, comforting and assuring.  And he is so very wise.  There is no doubt.  You see, as a man, he does not stand there alone.
            <br class="clear" /><br class="clear" />
            A woman stands with him.  Do I know her?  Her hazel eyes acknowledge the bond of their trust.  Her delicate stature is strengthened by truth and spirit.  Her heart overflows with compassion and understanding.  And she too is wise.  There is no doubt.  You see, she stands there with him, together, committed.
            <br class="clear" /><br class="clear" />
            So, it is St. John and Lauren who stand before me, their lives’ promises fulfilled.

            <blockquote>How did you choose this wedding venue?</blockquote>
            <p>
              Well, since we were new to the area, we had to start fresh.  So we spent a <em>couple</em> months
              looking at venues all around the area.  We looked far and wide at all different <b>wineries, mansions,
              wedding halls, golf clubs, and even the occasional <abbr title="Oh what a terrible drive that was">retreat.</abbr></b>  After much deliberation, we compromised on a site
              down in Saratoga.  It was beautiful, had amazing views, but somehow, it just <b>didn't feel <em>&quot;right.&quot;</em></b>
              And by this point we had exhausted almost every venue within an hour and a half drive.  But on a whim, we
              decided to cancel our reservation and keep looking.
            </p>
            <blockquote>I thought you looked everywhere? Where else would you go?</blockquote>
            <p>
              It was one of the last venues on our list, the <b>Thomas Fogarty Winery,</b> and it had amazing reviews.
              But for some reason or another, we had not had a chance to check it out yet.  So, we
              made an appointment with hopes that it would be <em>&quot;the place.&quot;</em>
            </p>
            <blockquote>Sounds promising!  How did it go?</blockquote>
            <p>
              The day of our visit had absolutely abysmal weather.  It was <em>gloomy,</em> <span style="color:#AAA">foggy,</span> and <span style="color:#009">pouring rain.</span>
              But the second we turned off the road and drove through the gates, <b>we both knew this
              was the place for our wedding.</b>  It was absolutely breath-taking, even in the worst weather.
            </p>
            <blockquote>Wonderful!  Congratulations!</blockquote>
            <p>
              Since our wedding will be at the end of May, we hope to have <b>a stunning, gorgeous, sunny day</b>
              and can’t wait for our guests to experience the <b>beauty of this vineyard!</b>

              They are also super close to downtown Palo Alto if you are interest in eating, shopping, or people watching during your visit.  There's even a giant mall only a couple blocks away.

              Pshaw, of course you are free to choose another local hotel, but we <i><b>heavily suggest</b></i> you stick with one of our choices because...

            <blockquote>Weather</blockquote>
            <p>
              Can be really unpredictable.  It may be California, but we're on
              top of a mountain - so more than likely it'll be windy and a bit
              chilly.  We won't really know the specifics until closer to the
              day.  But bring something warm just in case.
            </p>
            <blockquote>Attire</blockquote>
            <p>
              Guys, keep it simple, Suit and Tie (or Sport Jacket).  Gals, you already know, Dresses.
            </p>
            <blockquote>Driving</blockquote>
            <p>
              Under <strong>NO circumstance</strong> should you drive on
              <em><strong>Old</strong> La Honda</em> road.  Avoid it at all costs
              - even if your GPS says otherwise.  It's a windy, two-way, one-lane,
              no guardrail, dirt trail.  Instead you should be taking Highway 84
              - AKA <strong>La Honda</strong> road (notice it's not old).  Best
              directions are on Thomas Fogarty's website -
